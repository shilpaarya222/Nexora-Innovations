Key drivers include the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions, the need for businesses to enhance communication efficiency, and the growing preference for scalable and flexible solutions that cater to diverse industry requirements. Cisco resellers have the opportunity to capitalize on these trends by offering a broad portfolio of products, from on-premises installations to fully cloud-based UC solutions. Furthermore, Cisco's strong brand recognition and established presence in the enterprise communication sector give its resellers a competitive advantage in attracting both new customers and retaining existing ones. Market expansion is also expected from the rising demand for Cisco’s Webex platform, a leader in cloud-based video conferencing, which has seen a surge in adoption during the remote work revolution.
