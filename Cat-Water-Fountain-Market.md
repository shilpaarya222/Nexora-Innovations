The key drivers include the rising awareness of pet health and wellness, especially in terms of hydration and kidney function. Dehydration in cats can lead to severe health issues, which is prompting more owners to adopt water fountains that encourage drinking. This trend is particularly strong in regions like North America and Europe, where pet owners are more willing to invest in pet care products.</p> <p>Another contributing factor to market growth is the expanding variety of cat water fountains, which now come in various shapes, sizes, and materials.
