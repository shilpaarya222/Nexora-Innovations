The rise of online sales can be attributed to increased internet penetration, the convenience of shopping from home, and the wide variety of options available at competitive prices. Online platforms allow consumers to browse through multiple brands, compare prices, and read reviews before making purchase decisions. With the growing reliance on digital devices and e-commerce, many brands are shifting their focus toward creating user-friendly online stores and offering direct-to-consumer sales. Additionally, social media platforms and influencer collaborations have further fueled the online sales segment, allowing brands to effectively reach a younger, more tech-savvy audience who prioritize convenience and online shopping experiences.

Traditional retail outlets also benefit from in-store promotions, personalized customer service, and the ability to provide immediate product availability, making them an appealing choice for many consumers. In regions where online shopping penetration is still developing, offline sales continue to dominate the market. Additionally, consumers in some areas prefer the instant gratification of in-store purchases and the opportunity to browse a physical assortment of products.
