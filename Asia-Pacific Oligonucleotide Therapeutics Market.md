<p><strong>Asia-Pacific&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/817588/&amp;utm_source=GitHubF&amp;utm_medium=201"">Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Market</a> Insights</strong></p><p>Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Market size was valued at USD 4.3 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 9.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.1% from 2024 to 2030.</p><p><h2>Asia–Pacific Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Market by Application</h2><p>The Asia–Pacific oligonucleotide therapeutics market is segmented by application into various categories, with significant contributions from neuromuscular diseases, ATTR (Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy), hepatic VOD (Veno-Occlusive Disease), and others. Among these, neuromuscular diseases and hepatic VOD are the most dominant applications, with respective market shares of 51.69% and 42.23%. These applications have shown considerable growth owing to advancements in oligonucleotide-based therapeutics and increasing prevalence of the conditions. Neuromuscular diseases include disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare and progressive disease that leads to muscle degeneration and weakness. Oligonucleotide-based therapies, such as exon skipping agents, have emerged as promising treatments for DMD by targeting the specific genetic mutations that cause the disease, thus improving muscle function and patient quality of life. The increasing incidence of such conditions across the Asia–Pacific region is driving market demand for effective and innovative treatments.<br> <strong><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/817588/?utm_source=GitHubF&amp;utm_medium=201" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/817588/?utm_source=GitHubF&amp;utm_medium=201</a></p></strong></p><p>Hepatic VOD, on the other hand, is a life-threatening complication that occurs following stem cell transplantation and is characterized by obstruction of the small veins in the liver. The growing incidence of this condition, alongside the rising number of stem cell transplants in the Asia–Pacific region, has spurred the need for oligonucleotide therapeutics targeting this disease. The use of siRNA (small interfering RNA) molecules has shown potential in reducing liver inflammation and preventing further liver damage in patients with hepatic VOD. As a result, oligonucleotide therapies are becoming a vital part of the treatment landscape for hepatic VOD in this region. The market for hepatic VOD treatments is also bolstered by the increasing research and clinical trials focusing on the development of novel oligonucleotide drugs that can specifically target the liver and minimize systemic side effects.</p><h3>Key Trends in the Asia–Pacific Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Market</h3><p>Several key trends are shaping the Asia–Pacific oligonucleotide therapeutics market, primarily driven by advancements in technology, regulatory improvements, and an increasing patient population.
