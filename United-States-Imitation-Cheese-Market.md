Consumers are becoming more mindful of the environmental impact of food production, and imitation cheese offers a lower environmental footprint compared to traditional dairy cheese. Manufacturers are responding by incorporating sustainable sourcing practices and clean ingredients into their products. This includes using fewer additives and preservatives, as well as promoting ethical sourcing of raw materials.
